## Overview
C++ is very low level compared to C#, C# is a much higher level programming language unless you use advanced features such as Span. One of the main differences between C++ and C# is the level of abstraction they offer. C++ is a low-level language that gives you direct access to the hardware and memory management. You can write very fast and efficient code in C++, but you also have to deal with a lot of complexity and potential errors. C# is a high-level language that runs on a virtual machine and handles memory management for you. You can write code that is easier to read and maintain in C#, but you also have to sacrifice some performance and control.

## Performance

However, this is not a black-and-white distinction. Both languages have features that allow you to manipulate the level of abstraction depending on your needs. For example, C++ has smart pointers and containers that provide some automatic memory management and safety checks. C# has Span<T>, a type that represents a contiguous region of memory that can be used to access arrays, strings, or unmanaged memory without copying or allocating. Span<T> can improve the performance and memory usage of your C# code, but it also requires more care and attention.

## Features

C++ has many compilers such as GCC, CLang, MSVC, different behaviors on different OS / different compiler, For example, size_t, wchar_t in C++
Another difference between C++ and C# is the portability and compatibility of their code. C++ is a language that can be compiled by different compilers on different operating systems. This gives you a lot of flexibility and choice, but it also introduces some challenges. Different compilers may have different implementations of the language standard, different extensions or features, or different bugs or optimizations. This means that your C++ code may not behave the same way on different platforms or compilers.

For example, size_t is a type that represents the size of an object or a memory allocation in C++. However, the exact size of size_t may vary depending on the compiler or the architecture. On 32-bit systems, size_t is usually 4 bytes, while on 64-bit systems, it is usually 8 bytes. This can affect the compatibility and correctness of your code if you assume a certain size for size_t or use it interchangeably with other types.

Similarly, wchar_t is a type that represents a wide character in C++. However, the exact encoding and size of wchar_t may vary depending on the compiler or the operating system. On Windows, wchar_t is usually 2 bytes and uses UTF-16 encoding. On Linux, wchar_t is usually 4 bytes and uses UTF-32 encoding. This can affect the portability and interoperability of your code if you use wchar_t to store or manipulate Unicode strings.

## Tooling

C# has a worse tooling support than C++, C++ community is mainly text-based such as VIM and emacs, CMake improves the situation but it is still bad
A final difference between C++ and C# is the tooling support and community they have. C# is a language that has a rich and mature tooling ecosystem that supports various aspects of development such as editing, debugging, testing, refactoring, profiling, etc. You can use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Rider, or other IDEs or editors that provide a lot of features and integrations for C#. You can also use various frameworks and libraries that make your development easier and faster.

C++ is a language that has a less developed and more fragmented tooling ecosystem that supports fewer aspects of development or requires more configuration and customization. You can use VIM, emacs, Visual Studio Code, CLion, or other editors that provide some features and integrations for C++, but they may not be as comprehensive or consistent as those for C#. You can also use various build systems such as CMake, Makefile, Ninja, etc., but they may not be as easy or intuitive to use as those for C#.

Of course, this does not mean that C++ has no tooling support or community at all. There are many tools and resources available for C++ developers that can help them improve their productivity and quality. However, they may require more effort and knowledge to find and use them effectively.
